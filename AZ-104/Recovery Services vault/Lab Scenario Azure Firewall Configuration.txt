Configure Azure Firewall to control traffic flow between two virtual networks.

Requirements:
Azure subscription with permissions to create resources.
Two virtual networks (VNet1 and VNet2) created in the same region.
Virtual machines deployed in each VNet for testing connectivity.
Azure Firewall deployed in a subnet in either VNet1 or VNet2.
Tasks:
Create Azure Firewall:

Navigate to the Azure portal and create a new Azure Firewall resource.
Choose the appropriate subscription, resource group, and region.
Create a new public IP address or use an existing one.
Configure the firewall settings as per your requirements.
Place the firewall in a subnet within VNet1 or VNet2.
Configure Network Rules:

Define network rules to allow or deny traffic between VNet1 and VNet2.
Allow required inbound and outbound traffic based on your scenario. For example, allow HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, RDP, etc., as needed.
Deny all other traffic by default.
Associate Application Rules (Optional):

If your scenario requires filtering based on applications or FQDNs, define application rules accordingly.
Associate these rules with the network rules to enable application-level filtering.
Test Connectivity:

Deploy virtual machines in VNet1 and VNet2.
Test connectivity between the VMs across different VNets.
Verify that allowed traffic flows as expected and denied traffic is blocked.
Monitor and Troubleshoot:

Monitor Azure Firewall logs for traffic flows and rule matches.
Troubleshoot any connectivity issues by examining logs and adjusting rules as necessary.
Ensure that traffic is appropriately filtered according to your defined rules.
Additional Notes:
Take advantage of Azure Firewall diagnostic settings to stream logs to Azure Monitor for deeper insights into traffic patterns and security events.
Regularly review and update firewall rules to adapt to changing requirements and security threats.
